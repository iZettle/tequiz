Tetris was the very first programming project I finished in 2002-2003.
Back then I used C# and it was a GUI application running in Windows.

Recently I watched the movie [Tetris]. When I saw tetrominoes were rendered as
`[]` in the early versions, I was like: "Beautiful!".

So, after 20 years, I want to implement the game one more time, and make it
a TUI application.


## Fun fact:

> The game has monochrome graphics, and in the first revision of the game, the
> blocks in the tetrominos are represented by a pair of delete/rubout
> characters (character code 177); however, the rendering of this character
> code as a rectangle was a feature specific to the Soviet clone machines, an
> actual PDP-11 would instead display nothing. A later revision was made where
> the blocks are represented by a pair of square brackets instead.
